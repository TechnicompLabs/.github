## Technicomp Benchtop Linux

*The operating system for the technical workbench.*

Benchtop Linux is a stabilized workstation rolling release derived from openSUSE Tumbleweed and MicroOS, for x86 and ARM. Most of the system stays current with Tumbleweed, while the kernel and desktop move more cautiously: an LTS kernel by default, with a current kernel for hardware enablement, and the previous upstream-supported GNOME release. The operating system is an immutable image, and every update is a snapshot that can be rolled back. Applications and additional tools live in each user's profile through Flatpak and Homebrew. For the desktop in particular, the informal version of this policy is to let other people be the beta testers.

Benchtop Linux is in alpha. Installable images are released through the Build Service.
